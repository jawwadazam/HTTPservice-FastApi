# HTTP Service
## 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)


## Problem Statement

> Our customers are sending billions of requests each day that need to be processed. Today, all incoming requests are processed regardless of their validity, leading to slower processing. We want to filter out invalid requests (badly formatted, containing invalid values, missing required fields, â€¦) but keep a history on a day-by-day basis so that we can properly charge customers for the traffic they send.

## Installation
### Using Code
> This service requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.7+ to run.

Install pipenv to install the dependencies and devDependencies

```pip install pipenv
